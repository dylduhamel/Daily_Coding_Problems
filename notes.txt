Extremely important tips so far:
    1. Please please write every problem out
        Look at num. 20 :P
    2. Ask the interviewer more questions
    3. Think about the different styles of programs
        List them here
    4. Make sure to always add helper functions where it is needed


Technical Notes:
    1. An in-order traversal of a BST (binary search tree, which is sorted) gives the nodes in sorted order
    2. If given any problem where we must find something, it is important to ask if we can assume it is actually located there

Time Complexity Notes:
    1. When looking at the time complexity, just because it is a loop does not
    mean that is is O(N)
      Look at number 51, it loops through all of the cards, but is is always =
      to 52 cards, so it is actually O(1) time AND space complexity
